# quiz-app

As part of my time doing the Front End Development course on Thinkful one assigment was to design and code an interactive quiz app from scratch.

The minimum requirements are as follows:
The app must lead the user through a set of questions. The user should only see one question at a time, with new answers presented only after they have answered the current one.
Users should be able to input their answer to each question, with radio buttons or some other appropriate interface.
When the user answers the last question, the app should show his or her overall score.
Each question should be stored as a JavaScript object, and youâ€™ll probably want to store your list of questions in an array.

I love to travel and settled on building an airport code quiz, I went for a clean minimal design, also so I could continue to focus on learning javascript.
